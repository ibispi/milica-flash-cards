# milicaFlashCards

My sister studies medicine and asked of me to make her a program that would help her memorize terms in relation to their corresponding images, e.g. the word 'heart' would be associated with the image of the organ with the same name (this is a bad example, a better would be some latin term corresponding to a picture of symptoms of a disease for example).

That's how this program works. You create flash cards, where you can attach an image to each (only .png images are accepted; you add these images to the 'images' folder). Each Flash card also has certain text, which would have to be typed out in the 'test mode'.

Once you enter the test mode you get to see whether you can connect the text to the image.

You can have multiple different decks (which are loaded and created when the program is turned on).

##In order to run the program you need to have [LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org) installed, and you have to run the program from terminal. The program also has to be in your home directory (it's meant for Linux users). In case you want to put it into some other directory you have to open the main.py file and edit the saveLocation variable to the new directory.

### Have fun learning
